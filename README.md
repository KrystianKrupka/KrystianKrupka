A few words about me: 

Hey, welcome to my profile.

My name is Krystian, I am a lawyer and currently working on becoming a programmer.

I am interested in front-end and UI/UX design. 

You will probably ask, what is a lawyer doing here? Well, I like challenges but I also like IT. My dad is a computer scientist and he infected me with his passion long time ago, when I was still a child. In the meantime, I started to turn more and more towards graphics, web design and related topics. My path led me to law school, which I finished and have been providing legal services for several years now. 

Despite this, my interests and hobbies still drew me to IT. So I decided to set myself a new challenge and take up programming, more specifically front-end programming. At least for now. 

Currently, I'm learning HTML, CSS, JS, UI/UX - Adobe XD and Figma. I want to try my hand at this industry and maybe stay there forever. Law is interesting but it doesn't give me that much fun.
